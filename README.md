# Graphs
Project Description:
The project provides a Python program for working with directed graphs, allowing users to perform various operations on the graph data structure. It includes functionalities such as creating and manipulating graphs, adding and removing vertices and edges, calculating degrees, checking for edge existence, and finding paths within the graph based on different criteria.

Key Features and Functionalities:

Graph Creation: Users can create an empty graph or generate a graph with a specified number of vertices and random edges.

Vertex and Edge Management: This project allows users to add and remove vertices and edges, as well as change the cost of an edge.

Graph Information: Users can retrieve information about the graph, including the number of vertices and edges.

Edge Existence: The program provides a way to check whether an edge exists between two specified vertices.

Traversal and Printing: Users can traverse and print various aspects of the graph, including vertices, outbound and inbound neighbor lists, and edges.

File I/O: The project supports reading a graph from a file and writing a graph to a file.

Graph Copy: Users can create a copy of the graph.

Path Finding: The project includes methods for finding the lowest length path and the lowest cost path between two vertices within the graph.

Topological Sorting: There is support for topological sorting of the graph, which is useful for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs).

Highest Cost Path: Users can find the highest cost path between two vertices in the graph.

Connected Components: Finds connected components in unsigned graphs, strongly connected components in signed graphs, and biconnected components in unsigned graphs.

Cycle Detection: Verifies if a connected graph contains any negative cycles.

Shortest Paths Matrix: Computes and displays the matrix with all the shortest paths between vertices.

Number of Paths: Calculates the number of paths between two given vertices.

Spanning Trees: Constructs spanning trees using Kruskal's and Prim's algorithms.

Number of Paths: Calculates the number of paths between two given vertices.

Error Handling: The project includes error handling for various operations, ensuring robustness.

Overall, this Python project provides a versatile tool for working with directed graphs, making it suitable for a wide range of applications in graph theory and related fields. It offers functionalities for graph creation, manipulation, analysis, and path finding, making it a valuable resource for graph-related tasks.
